# Four Tiers to Successful Testing
This repo will be a good starting point to start testing in a successful TDD fashion. Listed below are the testing tools this application will be using. 

- Flow : https://flow.org/ : JavaScript Type Checking
- Jest : https://facebook.github.io/jest/ : Test Runner
- Enzyme : http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ : Testing tool 
- Chromeless : https://github.com/graphcool/chromeless : Ui Testing Tool for e2e Testing
- jsDoc : http://usejsdoc.org/ : Documentation Generator : 
-- Have to use documentation due to flow annotations : https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation/blob/master/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md

I will be starting off with a create react app under the *client* folder. The root of the application will be an *Express* application. 

The *create react app* will be ejected so I will have access to the webpack files and able to load the required testing tools. 

## Find more info in the wiki
The wiki will include some good information as I make slides and talks about each of the testing tools and how the four tier works in a coporate environent.

## Run Example :

`root : npm start`

cd into *client*

`client: npm start`

## Run Docs example :
`client: npm run docs`

You will see a port number and the docs will be hosted on that port.
