# Four Tiers to Successful Testing
This repo will be a good starting point to start testing in a successful TDD fashion. Listed below are the testing tools this application will be using. 

- Flow : https://flow.org/
- Jest : https://facebook.github.io/jest/
- Enzyme : http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/
- Chromeless : https://github.com/graphcool/chromeless

I will be starting off with a create react app under the *client* folder. The root of the application will be an *Express* application. 

The *create react app* will be ejected so I will have access to the webpack files and able to load the required testing tools. 

## Find more info in the wiki
The wiki will include some good information as I make slides and talks about each of the testing tools and how the four tier works in a coporate environent.
